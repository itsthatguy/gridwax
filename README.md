Vertical Rhythm is the spacing and arrangement between words as a user reads down the page. On the web, this is a difficult thing to get right, even with tools like [Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/) assisting. The problem really comes in, when you have multiple columns of text. If you want text lines to consistently land in the same places, you really need a visual aid that you can quickly drop in at any point as a reference.

This is where the [Gridwax](http://gridwax.herokuapp.com) bookmarklet comes in; Once you’ve got it secured on your bookmark bar, you can drop the overlay on your site, and use hotkeys to quickly adjust it to match your baseline.

#### Where to get it: [gridwax.herokuapp.com](http://gridwax.herokuapp.com)
